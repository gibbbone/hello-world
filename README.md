# Git: first steps
Hi, I'm Gibbone and here's a GIF of me learning to grok `git`. 

![Example](monkeygif.gif)

This is a test repository for the hello-world Github guide + some other things I've learned while tinkering with git.

- [This is my first attempt](https://github.com/giovannibonaccorsi/hello-world/blob/master/1_first_attempt.md), with hilarious errors
- [This is my second attempt](https://github.com/giovannibonaccorsi/hello-world/blob/master/2_full_procedure.md), with also some unnecessary details and explanations.
- [This is the whole script I've used](https://github.com/giovannibonaccorsi/hello-world/blob/master/3_the_short_story.md), with no bells and whistles, just the code to type and some short line comments. You can actually paste the code in bash and make your full first git flow.
