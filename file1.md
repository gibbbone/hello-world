This is a test markdown file. It has been used to test the command line procedure outlined [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

The code I've actually used to create it is the following. Starting from a test folder on Desktop:

    # clone the original repository
    git clone https://github.com/giovannibonaccorsi/hello-world
    
    # move inside the directory
    cd hello-world
    
    # make a new branch and check it 
    git branch hello2
    git checkout hello2 

    # create a new file and write on it
    gedit file1.md
